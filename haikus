Below are some haiku's for Haiku that once were posted on a wiki:


Out of paper

When horrid hardware	
rattles in unfed status:
Stifle with paper. 
-Meanwhile

Input you've put in
is now supposed to flow out.    
Help it land nicely.
-Meanwhile

Out of ink

Like you, I'm speechless
a white sheet reflecting doubt.                                                              
Be sure to buy ink.
-Meanwhile

All that serves the eye		
exists for contrast's sake.
So, will you get ink?
-Meanwhile

Incorrect login
	  
Access is denied.
Wrong username or password.
Please check your spelling.
-hKey

The data you've sent
arrived to fall on deaf ears.
Re-word your input.
-Meanwhile

And to make things worse:
your pet's name is not of use.
Incorrect login.
-Meanwhile
 
Shutdown
		
Only a machine.
But before it is turned off
It asks 'Will I dream?'
-hKey		  
			  
If OS ending	
equals RL beginning:
Be careful out there.
-Meanwhile

Error
			  
The program has crashed
We apologise for this
Please file bug report
-Unknown

A knot has been formed.
Disentangling proved in vain.
Cut for a new start.
-Meanwhile

A place to grind to 
A halt, found in your system.
No bloom for errors.
-Meanwhile

Page Not Found

At least it exists
in some webmaster's idea:
This damn page not found.
-Meanwhile

You wanted to go
To another location.
Alas, you could not.
-hKey

You clicked on a link,
But the target was unknown.
We wish we could help.
-hKey

This is a poem
For those who are still searching.
You'll get there someday
-hKey

Small words of comfort
Cannot soothe the longing heart
Of one who is lost.
-hKey

We cannot know where.
Heisenberg may be to blame
For this confusion.
-hKey

All is transient.
Like a dry leaf from a tree
This page has fallen.
-hKey

The young hide and seek
And some things never are found
Including this page.
-nonesuch

I've made a mistake;
I thought that page was right here!
Seek that which is lost.
-nonesuch

Access Denied

I'm so sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Access is denied.
-hKey

A bricked-up window.	
Not spraypaint but pixel text
says 'Access denied'.
-Meanwhile
																		
Tough? Just imagine				
Uniformed authority
bark it in your face.
-Meanwhile

Printer Not Ready
		
Leave the manual		
The cause may be down to earth
Check on/off light first.
-Meanwhile

File not found

A file has flung far.
Ideas of its whereabouts?		
Fetch them from there too.
-Meanwhile

Haiku Volume Too Full

Spillovers look nice
in buckets and volcanoes.			  						
This is something else.                                                           
-Meanwhile

Out of Memory

Overdemanding?
Return to Spartan lifestyle	
(with a touch of Zen).
-Meanwhile

Artistic
		  
A high Coup
for the Haiku
with a Haiku
-Vasper

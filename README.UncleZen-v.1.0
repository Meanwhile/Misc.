Uncle Zen's Brain for BeSam v1.0 
by Meanwhile

===========================

 
> Running the file:  

The three ways to run a Brain-file are described in BeSam's Readme file. 


> Writing your own Brain:

Writing your own Brain-file is really simple.
In addition to the essential info given by the developer of BeSam (Kevin P. Albrecht) in his Readme file, here are some -less important- remarks that still may be relevant to you:

+ If set up precisely according to the rules of Kevin's 'Brain Scripting Language' and saved with a .brn extension, your script will have turned into a Brain, recognizable by its associated icon. StyledEdit was used for writing Uncle Zen's Brain-file. As of the Silent Update version UZ has its own custom icon.
If needed, you can set the MIME setting of your Brain-file by using the FileType add-on and select 'text/x-vnd.kpa-sambrain'.

+ For user-convenience, I made sure to have Uncle Zen's replies fit into the reply bar at BeSam's default window size -even though it can be resized. This also keeps up the speed of the conversation.
Anyhow, you'll probably find that the limited maximum size of a Brain (16 KB) forces you to keep your replies short for variety's sake.

+ Kevin P. Albrecht is on GitHub at https://github.com/onlyafly 

+ BeSam can be downloaded from this page: https://www.kevinalbrecht.com/code/sam/index.html. IIRC the source code for BeSam is lost.


> Development:

A possible version 2.0 will depend on BeSam's development. (Version 1.0 made use of BeSam's latest version -being version 2.1.0 - Interpreter Version 5.1.0, dated July 30th 1999)


> Thank you:

Thank you Kevin P. Albrecht for creating BeSam!


> Feedback:

Any questions or comments you might have are perhaps best posted at Uncle Zen's download page on BeBits -by making use of the site's Talkback feature.

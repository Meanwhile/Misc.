# Misc.
Info on what's in this 'Misc.' repository:


*BBI3.1.png* - A before/after image showing the contents of BeBeautifiedIcons3.1.zip

*BeBeautifiedIcons3.1.zip* - A collection of BeOS replacement icons I made long ago. Note the info in its Readme is partly outdated by now.

*PalmHaiku.mp4* - Old video of Haiku icons in action on a Palm Pre. Placed here because the link on my Flickr page doesn't seem to work anymore.

*README.UncleZen-V.1.0* - A Readme for the Uncle Zen.brn file that loads into Kevin Albrecht's BeSam, the Scriptable Artificial Mind for BeOS (text has been updated).

*README.md* - The Readme you're reading now.

*SLRS1.01.zip* - A splashscreen and throbber designed for the BeOS version of Seamonkey (SLRS stands for 'Seamonkey Logo Replacement Suite').

*Uncle Zen.brn* - The original Turing test-beating brain file for BeSam I wrote many years ago.

*UZss.png* - Screenshot once used on BeBits.com showing BeSam in action.
